Add it to your inventory:

http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/53599-My-Contribution-Inventory-System-Free (a free one, not the only, but it is an inventory system)


ok, lets start simple.

This is the code out of the first link:
 
function OnMouseOver () {
    renderer.material.color -= Color(0.1, 0, 0) * Time.deltaTime;
}


Lets make a box, and throw that code on the box. When you put your mouse over it, 
it should start cycling the color over to cyan. 
As you leave your mouse over it, 
it will continue to go until it reaches cyan completely.

Taking that code, lets expand add the code from the second link. We are also going to add in a variable to manage the gui and an OnMouseExit function.
 
private var showGUI : boolean = false;
 
function OnMouseOver () {
    showGUI = true;
}
 
function OnMouseExit () {
    showGUI = false;
}
 
function OnGUI () {
    if(showGUI)
        GUI.Label (Rect (10, 10, 100, 20), "Hello World!");
}


OK, so now, when we put our mouse over the cube, we get a gui that says "Hello World!" as if that is useful.

Lets check to see if our mouse button is down... Code from the third link.
 
private var showGUI : boolean = false;
 
function OnMouseOver () {
    showGUI = true;
    if(Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0))
        Debug.Log("Pressed left click.");
    if(Input.GetMouseButtonDown(1))
        Debug.Log("Pressed right click.");
    if(Input.GetMouseButtonDown(2))
        Debug.Log("Pressed middle click.");
}
 
function OnMouseExit () {
    showGUI = false;
}
 
function OnGUI () {
    if(showGUI)
        GUI.Label (Rect (10, 10, 100, 20), "Hello World!");
}

Now, lets look at the player, and start his "I am cutting down a tree" animation. 
To do this, we first have to reference the player. We can do this by finding him.

 
private var showGUI : boolean = false;
private var chopping : boolean = false;
 
function OnMouseOver () {
    showGUI = true;
    if(Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0))
        chopping = true;
   
    if(chopping)
        GameObject.Find("Player").animation.CrossFade("Cut");
}
 
function OnMouseExit () {
    showGUI = false;
}
 
function OnGUI () {
    if(showGUI)
        GUI.Label (Rect (10, 10, 100, 20), "Chop down this tree");
}
